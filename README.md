# Python Projects  
produced by: Quang Dong Nguyen

This repository is dedicated to major and minor projects that I have been completing over the past 2 years as a student at Western Sydney University and as well as a Freelance Data Analyst at JungTalents. Each project was done through Python Languages and Python editor tools such as Jupyter Notebook to showcase not just my study domain proficiency but also the practical application of Python in the real world. Meanwhile, there are some of the data sources are obtained through Kaggle, which is a mainstream platform used for datasets, insight discovery and sharing projects.
